* Enable writing generated code as macros. It's painful to generate code using the AST directly.
  Using a quasi-quoted macro to express code, a la Nim, should make generating code much smoother.
  Note: this will require parsing the target language, TS currently.

* File output. Start writing to files. Copying from the terminal output is getting old.

* Generate translation certification test.

* Probably should compile to Rust.

* Support different backends. Should be able to compile to different languages as well
  as architectures / patterns. For example, compile to microservices, monolithic backend,
  relational DB, MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc.
