* Separate concrete from abstract syntax. Example: state variables are just identifiers
  in concrete syntax, but can be elaborated to a separate state var node in abstract syntax.
  This gives more semantic information to identifiers so that all usages of them are aware if
  they're a state variable or not.

* Documentation. What builtins are available and what the schema is of the syntax type hierarchy
  is totally opaque right now. 

* Type system. The foundation is there syntactically, but no actual type checking is performed
  right now.  

* VSCode plugin.

* Get back to experimenting with implementation derivation via effects.
