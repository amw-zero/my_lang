Handling endpoint backwards compatibility? Services that an external party 
consumes, or something like blue-green deployments where there are multiple
versions of the application running in tandem. Since endpoint names and implementations
are generated, how do we prevent clients from breaking when calling the endpoints that
they are aware of?

Monitoring? many monitoring tools assume that the code being monitored
is going to be human-readable. Generating the implementation code makes
this difficult, though maybe the generated code can remain human-readable.
If not, this is a problem to think about.

How to compile queries for complicated logic? example: Deal Connections.
Might just want a way to hook into generated architecture to override
queries / other things. This is comparable to inline assembly.
